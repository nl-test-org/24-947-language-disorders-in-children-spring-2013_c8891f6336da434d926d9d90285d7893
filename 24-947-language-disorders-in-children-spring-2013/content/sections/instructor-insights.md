Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _24.947 Language Disorders in Children_ as it was taught by Professor Suzanne Flynn in Spring 2013.

This course focused on reading and discussion of current linguistic theory, first language acquisition and language disorders in young children. It also focused on development of a principled understanding of language disorders at the phonological, morphological and syntactic levels, examining ways in which these disorders confront theories of language and acquisition.
